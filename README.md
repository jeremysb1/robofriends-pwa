# robofriends-pwa

Previously, I added PWA capabilities to a react app

Now, I am testing the React Components' output with Enzyme ![Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/)

## Dependencies

To run the project:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`


To test with Enzyme: 

run 'npm i --save-dev enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16'
